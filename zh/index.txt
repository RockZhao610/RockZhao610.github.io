a:T58f,Compound limb motor imagery (MI) paradigms, involving coordinated upper and lower limb imagery, align naturally with human walking pattern and have demonstrated relatively high decoding accuracy in offline electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) studies. However, their online implementation remains largely unexplored due to practical challenges. In this study, we propose an online compound limb-MI-BCI walking system based on a deep learning model and a shared control strategy. We first evaluate three common deep learning models (EEGNet, DeepConvNet, and ShallowConvNet) for decoding performance without complex preprocessing or handcrafted features. Offline results from 11 participants show that all models achieve accuracies significantly above chance, with EEGNet achieving the highest accuracy (70.76 ± 8.50%). Building on this, we employ EEGNet with transfer learning for decoding, and a shared control strategy based on majority voting and prior knowledge to enhance walking control in the online system. Online experiments with 8 participants demonstrate feasibility, yielding an average decoding accuracy of 63.54 ± 6.83%, a task completion rate of 89.17 ± 3.15% with an averaged step frequency of 13.74 ± 0.27 steps per minute. These results demonstrate the system’s online decoding capability and practical potential for natural lower-limb BCI applications in rehabilitation.b:T5a7,In advancing brain-computer interface (BCI), force feedback has demonstrated potential in enhancing neurophysiological interactions during motor tasks. This study investigated the impact of force feedback on brain activity and the accuracy of decoding movement direction. We developed an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI paradigm with four levels of force feedback (i.e., 0 N, 8 N, 16 N, 24 N) applied during right-hand movements to left and right directions. Six participants were involved to ensure robust results. Three deep learning models—DeepConvNet, ShallowConvNet, and EEGNet—were used to decode movement directions. Findings from event-related desynchronization/event-related synchronization (ERD/ERS) and movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) indicated that increased force feedback significantly enhanced the brain’s response to motor stimuli. The decoding results revealed that force feedback notably improved decoding accuracy of DeepConvNet and EEGNet, particularly under medium and high-intensity conditions. Specifically, three models demonstrated accuracy improvements of 11%, 4%, and 12% under high-intensity force feedback, respectively. These results suggest that specific force feedback enhances motor area responsiveness, improving movement intention decoding in BCI. Our study confirms the positive impact of force feedback on BCI performance, highlighting the potential of force feedback-based BCI systems.c:T77d,@inproceedings{li2024m2vip-force-feedback,
